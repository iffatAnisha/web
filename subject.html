<h2>Choosing the Right Yarn and Hook</h2>
<p>Before learning how to crochet, one must select <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/best-yarn-for-crochet-979065"> the right yarn</a> that will match what they will be making. There are four main types of yarn, each serving different purposes: wool, cotton, acrylic, and crochet thread. Wool yarn is the recommended choice for beginners, as it is made of a resilient fiber, so you will be able to unravel it smoothly if you made a mistake. Practicing crochet stitches is much easier with wool. Cotton yarn is more difficult to work with than wool yarn, as it is made of an inelastic fiber. Cotton is great at keeping its shape, and is recommended for warm weather projects, as it is very light and thin. Acrylic yarn is the most commonly used yarn as it comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes. Although fibers can get broken apart easily, acrylic yarn is very versatile and can be used for many different projects. Crochet thread, while not really a yarn, is an excellent choice when creating delicate items with intricate patterns, as the thread is thin and sturdy. Now that you have some information on different types of yarn, think of what you will be making and choose your yarn wisely!</p>
<p>Like the wide variety of yarn, there are also many crochet hooks to choose from. Choosing the right hook is crucial to having a successful crocheting experience. All yarn has a specific thickness, which is called yarn weight. It is always listed on the yarn's packaging, as well as the recommended hook size. For beginner crocheters, it is advised that a <a href="https://www.knitpicks.com/yarn/worsted/c/30010106">worsted weight yarn</a> is chosen, which corresponds to a 4mm hook, or medium size. Crochet hooks come in different varieties, some made of steel, other made with wood or plastic, The type of hook you use is completely based on preference.</p>
    
<h2>The Slip Knot and Holding Your Tools</h2>
<p>To begin any crochet project, one must create a slip knot with their yarn. Doing so is quite simple, but messing up will lead to consequences. There are multiple ways of creating a slip knot, but I found this way to be quick and easy. Begin by creating a loop with your yarn around your finger, leaving about four inches at the end. Make sure you are holding the ball end of the yarn and leaving the free end by itself. Create an x shape with the yarn around your finger, with the ball end in front. Loop over your ball end over the loop you already have and pull the bottom loop over the top loop and remove the loop from your finger. Pull the loop tightly and place it on your hook. You know you did this correctly if you are able to tighten the loop by pulling the end yarn and loosen it by pulling the ball end. If this method is uncomfortable for you, check out some <a href="https://www.crochetguru.com/crochet-slip-knot.html">other</a> methods. </p>
<p>
With your slip knot on your hook, you are ready to start crocheting, but first you must figure out how to hold your yarn and hook. This is a lot more difficult than it looks, as the way you hold your materials is different for every crocheter. The most common hold is the knife hold. Like the name suggests, you hold the crochet hook exactly like you hold a small knife with your dominant hand. With your other hand, you hold the yarn. To hold the yarn, you take the ball yarn and wrap it around your pointer finger loosly. You can also first wrap it around your pinky and then your pointer finger for more control. You then hold the end of the yarn by pinching it with your thumb and middle finger. Make sure you are able to control the placement of the ball yarn with your pointer finger. Getting comfortable holding your tools takes a lot of practice, but once you get used to crocheting, it will be simple! </p>
    
<h2>Reading Crochet Patterns</h2>
<p>With hundreds of different crochet stitches, it is important to be able to recognise them when reading crochet pattern templates. All crochet stitches are abbreviated, making templates quite difficult to read for beginners. This is why it is important to memorize the basic crochet abbreviations, which makes life so much easier. Keep in mind that US terminology and <a href=https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/crochet-abbreviations>UK terminology</a> differ greatly, as many vintage stitch patterns are written in UK terminology. it is recommended that one memorized a few UK terms as well.</p>
